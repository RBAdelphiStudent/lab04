All of these questions deal with the ticket machine example bundled in this repo. You should fork this repo and clone the fork to work on the code locally.

## How can we tell from just its header that `setPrice` is a method and not a constructor?
```
public void setPrice(int cost)
```
* One can tell from the header that `setPrice` is a method and not a constructor because the header because it has no output and its name does not match that of the class.

## Complete the body of the setPrice method so that it assigns the value of its parameter to the price field. Write your new method in the `lab04-ticket-machine`.

## Complete the body of the following method, whose purpose is to add the value of its parameter to a field named `score`.
```
/**
 * Increase score by the given number of points.
 */
public void increase(int points)
{
  score=score+points;
}
```
## Is the `increase` method in the previous question a mutator? If so, how could you demonstrate this?
* The `increase` method in the previous question is a mutator because it changes a parameter to the field `score`.

## Complete the following method, whose purpose is to subtract the value of its parameter from a field named `price`. Add your new method to the `lab04-ticket-machine`.
```
/**
 * Reduce price by the given amount.
 */
public void discount(int amount)
{
  price=price-amount;
}
```

## Write down exactly what will be printed by the following statement:
```
System.out.println("My cat has green eyes.");
```
* My cat has green eyes.

## Add a method called `prompt` to the `TicketMachine` class in the `lab04-ticket-machine`. This should have a `void` return type and take no parameters. The body of the method should print the following single line of output:
```
Please insert the correct amount of money.
```

## What do you think would be printed if you altered the fourth statement of `printTicket` so that `price` also has quotes around it, as follows?
```
System.out.println("# " + "price" + " cents.");
```
The system would print `# price cents.`

## What would be printed here?
```
System.out.println("# price cents.");
```
* The system would print `# price cents.`

## Could either of the previous two versions be used to show the price of tickets in different ticket machines? Explain your answer.

* Neither of the previous two versions could be used to show the price of tickets in different machines, as they print a String, "price", rather than the int `price`. Only the latter will show the actual price of the tickets when prompted.

## Add a `showPrice` method to the `TicketMachine` class in the `lab04-ticket-machine`. This should have a void return type and take no parameters. The body of the method should print (here `xyz` should be replaced by the value held in the `price` field when the method is called):
```
The price of a ticket is xyz cents.
```


## Create two ticket machines with differently priced tickets. Do calls to their showPrice methods show the same output, or different? How do you explain this effect?

## Modify the constructor of `TicketMachine` in the `lab04-ticket-machine` so that it no longer has a parameter. Instead, the price of tickets should be fixed at 1,000 cents. What effect does this have when you construct ticket-machine objects within BlueJ?

## Give the class two constructors. One should take a single parameter that specifies the price, and the other should take no parameter and set the price to be a default value of your choosing. Test your implementation by creating machines via the two different constructors.

## Implement a method, `empty`, that simulates the effect of removing all money from the machine. This method should have a `void` return type, and its body should simply set the `total` field to zero. Does this method need to take any parameters? Test your method by creating a machine, inserting some money, printing some tickets, checking the total, and then emptying the machine. Is the `empty` method a mutator or an accessor?
